    Buffer
        it is a global scope constructor
        
        const b=new Buffer.from('abcxyz');
        console.log(b);

        output -> 
        <Buffer 61 62 63 78 79 7a>

        hexadecimal to decimal
            61 in hexadecimal -> 97
            80 in hexadecimal -> 7a

###
        A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a formal system for uniquely identifying resources and consists of
        two types:
            URLs (Uniform Resource Locator) and URNs (Uniform Resource Name).

        A URL, also known as a web address, identifies a web resource as well as its location on a computer network and how to access it (e.g. http://www.library.pitt.edu).

        A URN is a formal naming scheme that identifies a resource, but does not indicate its location or how to access it (e.g. ISBN, ISSN)

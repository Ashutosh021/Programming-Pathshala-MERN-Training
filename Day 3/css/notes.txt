    grid
        it is a 2D representation of data

        display:grid; 
        grid-template-columns: 100px 200px;   -> fixed first column  100px second 200px
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;   -> fr = fraction 
        grid-template-rows: ;  -> row wise arrangement

        column-gap:10px; -> gaps between columns
        row-gap:10px;     -> gaps between rows

      used to gave space column wise
        grid-column-start     
        grid-column-end  

      used to gave space row wise
        grid-row-start

        grid-template-columns:repeat(auto,1fr);
        grid-template-columns:repeat(auto-fit);
        grid-template-columns:repeat(auto-fit,minmax((50px,1fr)));


###
  positions
    static  -> can't apply TBLR
    relative -> apply TBRL      gap not fullfilled by any other element   ->position change from its initial position
    absolute -> apply TBLR      gap fullfilled by any other element        ->position change from top of the document (html)
    sticky -> apply TBLR        gap not fullfilled by any other element         ->stick with the scrren when scroll
    fixed -> apply TBLR         gap fullfilled by any other element       ->fixed reference point body can't change (also fixed with scroll)


###
  media query
    @media (max-width: 600px){     apply less then 600px
      style here ... 
    }


### 
  animation -> done in multiple steps
  transition -> done in single steps
  transform -> change the position 


### psuedo class
    -> pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element
    
    like button:hover
